#printing something out in ruby

#everything is an object in ruby, if you typed print self it will treat it as an object
#print self;

#printing out something if it's even or odd, number.even? returns either a true or false. the question mark after .even allows that to happen.
#def odd_or_even(number)
#return print.even?
